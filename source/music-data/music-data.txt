.. _element_musicData:

The musicData element
--------------------------

The :token:`musicData` element is just a collection of objects, mainly notes and rests, that are attached to the staves of the instrument. These objects are named *staff objects* :


.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    musicData: (musicData { `note` | `rest` | `chord` | `clef` | `key` | `time` | 
             :              `barline` | `metronome` | `newSystem` | `spacer` |
             :              `direction` | `figuredBass` | `goFwd` }* )

The :token:`metronome` element is accepted for backwards compatibility with 2.0. But in future this element will not be possible here and must go as an attachement to a :token:`direction` element.

Examples::

    //single note
    (musicData (n c4 q))

    //C major scale:
    (musicData (n c4 q)(n d4 q)(n e4 q)(n f4 q)(n g4 q)(n a4 q)(n b4 q)(n c5 q))

    //Short fragment with a measure:
    (musicData (clef G)(key C)(time 2 4)(n c4 q)(n e4 q)(n g4 q)(n c5 q)(barline))
